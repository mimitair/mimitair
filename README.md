# Who Am I?
Hello there. Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Miguel, aka mimitair (the coolest gamer-tag my 12-yo self could come up with). 
I'm currently working as a PhD student in the Soil- and Water Management lab at the KULeuven, Belgium (https://ees.kuleuven.be/en/bwb).
In our lab, we harness the power of micro-organisms to process and valorize a wide variety of waste streams (agricultural waste, wastewater, plastics...).
In this context, I'm now studying the enzymatic degradation of natural and synthetic polymers, combining both dry- and wet-lab work.
