# Who Am I?
Hello there. Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Miguel, aka mimitair (the coolest gamer-tag my 12-yo self could come up with). 
I'm currently working as a PhD student in the Soil- and Water Management lab at the KULeuven, Belgium (https://ees.kuleuven.be/en/bwb).
In our lab, we harness the power of micro-organisms to process and valorize a wide variety of waste streams (agricultural waste, wastewater, plastics...).
In this context, I'm now studying the enzymatic degradation of natural and synthetic polymers, combining both dry- and wet-lab work.

# Software
- **CAGEcleaner** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-780000) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/bash-003049) 

    Tool to filter redundancy in gene cluster mining hits by dereplication of host genomes and/or genomic region. Can be seen as a complementary tool for [cblaster](https://github.com/gamcil/cblaster.git). Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/LucoDevro/CAGEcleaner.git).

- **biolib** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-780000)

    General-purpose library for common bioinformatics tasks. Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mimitair/biolib.git).
